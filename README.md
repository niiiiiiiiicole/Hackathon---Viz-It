## Project Overview

**Hackathon---Viz-It** is designed to empower analytics teams with instant, intuitive visualization capabilities for SQL query outputs. By addressing the challenges of slow exploratory analysis, delayed anomaly detection, and inefficient collaboration, Viz-It streamlines the path from raw data to actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

Analytics teams often struggle to validate data, investigate anomalies, and pinpoint root causes due to the lack of an instant way to visualize SQL query output. Without a quick and intuitive visualization tool, teams face:

- Slower exploratory analysis and data discovery
- Delays in identifying data integrity issues like missing values or anomalies
- Difficulty spotting correlations and comparing trends
- Inefficient root-cause analysis
- Barriers to insight-sharing among analysts working on related domains
- Slower iteration with stakeholders on dashboard design and data presentation

## Solution

**Viz-It** provides a seamless platform for instantly visualizing SQL query results, enabling:

- Faster and more effective exploratory analysis
- Rapid identification of data integrity issues
- Easy detection of trends, correlations, and anomalies
- Streamlined collaboration and sharing of insights
- Accelerated dashboard prototyping and iteration

## Features

- Instant visualization of SQL query outputs
- Multiple chart types for flexible data exploration
- Simple, intuitive user interface designed for analysts
- Easy sharing and collaboration tools
